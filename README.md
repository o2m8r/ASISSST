<b>Automated SIS Survey ScripT:</b><br>

--> This script is created to automate the filling of survey forms on Faculty Evaluation 1st Semester SY1718. I am not responsible on anything when you use this script. Use this on your own risk. You can also try filling 20 (radio)buttons per professor and if you have a 8 professor on this sem then you are filling up 8*20=160, then there are 160 (radio)buttons waiting for you to click them alongside with your sincerity :). Special thanks to Google, Youtube, Stackoverflow, w3schools, and to my potato computer for making this script possible.<br><br>
